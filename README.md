Analyzing Motorcycle Part Sales SQL Project
Overview

In this project, we will analyze the wholesale sales data of a company that sells motorcycle parts across three warehouse sites. The goal is to determine the net revenue generated by product lines monthly and across different warehouses. We will use SQL queries to aggregate and summarize the sales data, and then utilize reporting skills to present insights and trends.

Skills Used
SQL querying for data extraction and aggregation.
Reporting skills for summarizing findings and presenting insights.
Data visualization (optional) for creating charts and graphs to visualize trends.
Steps Involved
Data Understanding:

Understand the database schema and tables involved (sales, products, warehouses, etc.).
Identify key fields such as sale_date, quantity, unit_price, product_id, and warehouse_id.
Connecting to Database:

Connect to the database where the sales data is stored (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

Reporting:

Use reporting tools (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets) to create summary reports and dashboards.
Include key metrics like total revenue by month and warehouse, top-selling products, etc.
Visualization (Optional):

Create visualizations (e.g., line charts, bar graphs) to illustrate trends and patterns in the sales data.
Tools like Tableau or Python libraries (matplotlib, seaborn) can be used for this purpose.
Insights and Recommendations:

Analyze the findings to derive actionable insights.
Provide recommendations based on the analysis to improve revenue streams or operational efficiency.
Upcoming Skills Development
Data-Driven Decision Making in SQL Course: This course will help further enhance SQL skills for data analysis and decision-making.
Advanced Reporting and Visualization: Continued practice and learning in reporting and visualization tools to improve presentation of analytical findings.
Conclusion
By completing this project, we aim to provide valuable insights into the motorcycle parts sales, helping the company understand their revenue streams across different warehouses and product lines. The project showcases SQL proficiency along with reporting and potentially visualization skills, crucial for data-driven decision-making.
