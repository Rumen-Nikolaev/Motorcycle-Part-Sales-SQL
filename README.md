Analyzing Motorcycle Part Sales SQL Project
Overview

In this project, we will analyze the wholesale sales data of a company that sells motorcycle parts across three warehouse sites. The goal is to determine the net revenue generated by product lines monthly and across different warehouses. We will use SQL queries to aggregate and summarize the sales data, and then utilize reporting skills to present insights and trends.
