# Analyzing Motorcycle Part Sales

## Project Overview

In this project, we will analyze the wholesale sales data of a company that sells motorcycle parts across three warehouse sites. The goal is to determine the net revenue generated by product lines on a monthly basis and across different warehouses. We will utilize SQL queries to aggregate and summarize the sales data and present insights and trends.

## Skills Used

- **SQL Querying**: Data extraction and aggregation.
- **Reporting**: Summarizing findings and presenting insights.
- **Data Visualization (Optional)**: Creating charts and graphs to visualize trends.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Understanding
- Understand the database schema and tables involved (e.g., sales, products, warehouses).
- Identify key fields such as:
  - `sale_date`
  - `quantity`
  - `unit_price`
  - `product_id`
  - `warehouse_id`

### 2. Connecting to Database
- Connect to the database where the sales data is stored (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

### 3. SQL Queries
- Use SQL queries to extract and aggregate sales data for analysis.
- Save the SQL code in `code.sql`.

### 4. Reporting
- Use reporting tools (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets) to create summary reports and dashboards.
- Include key metrics like:
  - Total revenue by month and warehouse
  - Top-selling products

### 5. Visualization (Optional)
- Create visualizations (e.g., line charts, bar graphs) to illustrate trends and patterns in the sales data.
- Tools like Tableau or Python libraries (matplotlib, seaborn) can be utilized.

### 6. Insights and Recommendations
- Analyze findings to derive actionable insights.
- Provide recommendations based on the analysis to improve revenue streams or operational efficiency.

## Upcoming Skills Development
- **Data-Driven Decision Making in SQL Course**: Enhance SQL skills for data analysis and decision-making.
- **Advanced Reporting and Visualization**: Continued practice and learning in reporting and visualization tools to improve the presentation of analytical findings.

## Conclusion
By completing this project, we aim to provide valuable insights into the motorcycle parts sales, helping the company understand their revenue streams across different warehouses and product lines. The project showcases SQL proficiency, along with reporting and potentially visualization skills, which are crucial for data-driven decision-making.
